## ✨ What This Does

This project gives you **4 different ways** to remove the background from any image using Python — pick the one that suits you best:

| Script | Interface | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| `bg_remove_normal.py` | Terminal (type path) | Quick single image |
| `bg_remover.py` | Terminal (type or browse) | CLI power users |
| `bg_removes_interactive.py` | GUI window | Click-and-go, single image |
| `bg_removes.py` | GUI window | Single **or** batch (multiple images) |

## 💡 How It Works

This tool uses [rembg](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg), which runs a deep learning model (U²-Net) locally on your machine to detect and remove image backgrounds — completely offline.

---

## 🛠️ Customization Ideas (Great for Beginners!)

- Add a drag-and-drop interface
- Add a before/after image preview
- Save outputs to a custom folder
- Add support for transparent background colors
